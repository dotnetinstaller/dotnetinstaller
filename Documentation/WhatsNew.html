    <h3>
        1.7 (TBD)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug: wrong error when missing configuration.xml (invalid schema version vs. missing
            configuration.xml).</li>
        <li>Converted the projects to Visual Studio 2008 format.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        1.6 (29 June 2009)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First release off <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dotnetinstaller">CodePlex</a>.</li>
        <li>New MSI installer. You can use the installer or a binary distribution package.</li>
        <li>New, largely rewritten, CHM documentation.</li>
        <li>Changed behavior of file embedding to explicit: disabled automatic embedding of
            files from <code>msi</code>, <code>download</code> and <code>openfile</code> components,
            set <code>/Embed</code> to <code>True</code> by default.</li>
        <li>Added an <span style="color: #b22222; font-family: Courier New">EmbedFolder</span>
            configuration component to embed directories and subdirectories with an optional
            wildcard and configurable destination.</li>
        <li>Added parity between <code>EmbedFolder</code> and <code>EmbedFile</code> components
            which can be now specified in both the configuration and on the command line.
        </li>
        <li>InstallerLinker: embedded files that cannot be found are reported as errors with
            their full paths.</li>
        <li>InstallerLinker: Changed default value of <code>/AppPath</code>, now defaults to
            the current directory and not to the location of the configuration.xml.</li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller: embedded CABs are now segmented into 32-megabyte chunks. This reduces
            the minimum required memory for installers containing embedded CABs to about 48Mb,
            reduces paging and improves performance during extraction of large embedded CABs.
            Added editor and linker support for Windows Vista/XP 64. </li>
        <li>Added OS filter identifiers for Windows Server 2008. </li>
        <li>Added <code>InstalledCheckOperator</code> of 'And', 'Or' and 'Not' types that combine
            results from one or more <code>InstalledCheck</code> and <code>InstalledCheckOperator</code>
            elements. </li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller: Added <code>/componentArgs "component description":"parameters"</code>
            to dotNetInstaller.exe command line. This enables passing additional parameters
            to specific components declared in configuration.xml. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added support for configuration file XML comments and a text box
            where the developer can edit a comment, saved as an xml comment above the selected
            node. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: configuration tree now supports deletion of nodes with the keyboard
            Delete key and will popup the Add menu with the Insert key. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: components can be dragged and dropped between nodes. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: the About box can be closed with the Escape key. </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added Expand All, Collapse All, Move, Move Up and Move Down context
            menu items.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: Shift+Up and Shift+Down arrows move components up and down.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added support for multiline properties for most non-caption or
            button messages.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added shortcuts to open a configuratoin file (Ctrl+O), create a
            new configuration file (Ctrl+N), save the current configuration (Ctrl+S), generate
            an exe (F10), exit (Alt+F4) and refresh (F5). </li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: user no longer prompted for a configuration file name on New.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: the New and Open menu items are always enabled.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: added a status strip that reports general information, including
            Save or Load.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: closing a configuration no longer prompts to save changes when
            there were no changes made.</li>
        <li>InstallerEditor: writes schema and generator version information to configuration.xml.</li>
        <li>Added <code>allow_continue_on_error</code> globally and per-component: when false
            user is no longer prompted to continue on error, instead the user is informed of
            the failure and installation aborts. Combine this option with <code>auto_close_on_error</code>
            to get predictable failure behavior as bootstrapper will close after an element
            of setup failed. Note that in order for a component to allow continuing on error
            both the global and the component setting must be set to True. </li>
        <li>DotNetInstaller: warns and offers the user to abort if configuration was not generated
            with a matching version of InstallerEditor.</li>
        <li>DotNetInstaller: merged functionality of the Advanced component selector into the
            main window, removed the Advanced button. </li>
        <li>Added <code>dialog_show_required</code>: when false, required components are hidden.</li>
        <li>Added <code>dialog_show_installed</code>: when false, installed components are hidden.</li>
        <li>Added <code>must_reboot_required</code>: globally and per-component. Setting this
            option to true will prevent users from continuing when a reboot is required.
        </li>
        <li>Added <code>failed_exec_command_continue</code> per-component extending the global
            setting that defines the message to show when a component fails to install.
        </li>
        <li>Added optional <code>reboot_required</code>: a message that can be configured per
            component, extending the global setting. </li>
        <li>Added <code>auto_close_on_error</code>: changes behavior on component error, now
            optionally closing the bootstrapper. </li>
        <li>Added a set of options that enable resizing of the main installer dialog elements:
            dialog_position <code>dialog_components_list_position</code>, <code>dialog_message_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_bitmap_position</code>, <code>dialog_otherinfo_link_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_osinfo_position</code>, <code>dialog_install_button_position</code>,
            <code>dialog_cancel_button_position</code> and <code>dialog_skip_button_position</code>.
            Supports resizing coordinates selectively.</li>
        <li>Added <code>configuration_no_match_message</code> that displays as error when no
            configuration matching operating system, locale or processor architecture filters
            has been found. Removed unused <code>os_filter_not_match_message</code> and <code>processor_architecture_filter_not_match_message</code>.</li>
        <li>Added <code>#SYSTEMWINDOWSPATH</code> constant resolved to system Windows directory
            in paths.</li>
        <li>Added <code>#PID</code> constant resolved to process ID in paths.</li>
        <li>Added <code>embed</code> option to msi, openfile and download (sub)components to
            disable automatic file embedding.</li>
        <li>Added <code>lcidtype</code> option to the configuration file that can be set to
            the method to use to obtain the current LCID used to match a configuration. Now
            supports user.exe (KB181604), system and user methods.</li>
        <li>Expanded <code>status_installed</code> and <code>status_notinstalled</code> per-component.</li>
        <li>Download dialog <code>autostartdownload</code> default value is changed to <code>
            true</code>.</li>
        <li>Added <code>sourcepath</code> to support mixed-mode physical media distribution
            scenarios where frequently required components are embedded and other components
            downloaded.</li>
        <li>dotNetInstaller process exit code is now 0 on success, MSI return code on an MSI
            component failure, process exit code on a non-zero cmd component return, -2 on cancel
            from main dialog and -1 on any other error. Check <code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code> in batch
            scripts. </li>
        <li>Silent install support was extended to a full UI, basic UI and no UI mode, silent
            install no longer pops up progress dialogs, while basic UI install does without
            requiring user interaction. All UI modes are enabled via configuration and can be
            overriden from command line with /q (silent), /qb (basic UI) and /qn (full UI).</li>
        <li>Hidden folders and files are no longer embedded.</li>
        <li>Added <code>installation_none</code>, displayed instead of <code>installation_complete</code>
            when no components were required. </li>
        <li>Bug: cancel has no effect on the download dialog before download starts.</li>
        <li>Bug: download dialog will no longer appear when download is not required.</li>
        <li>Bug: command-line parameters are not preserved on reboot.</li>
        <li>Bug: /ComponentArgs cannot contain a colon.</li>
        <li>Bug: errors in command line arguments aren't reported.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        1.5 (25 Oct 2008)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added support for installing 64-bit applications, including WOW support for component
            installed checks, processor architecture restrictions per installation and/or component,
            etc. </li>
        <li>Added support for silent installs; silent mode can be declared either in the configuration
            XML or from the command line </li>
        <li>Added command_silent to the component of type "command" and cmdparameters_silent
            to the component of type "msi" that optionally replace command and cmdparameters
            parameters in a silent install </li>
        <li>Added an "alwaysdownload" configuration XML attribute to the download element; if
            this value is false, the file will not be download if it already exists locally
            (this enables using the same configuration XML for both online and offline installs)
        </li>
        <li>Modified configuration-level OS filter matching to be included as part of the configuration
            filter checks (previously, the program would exit if an unmatched configuration-level
            OS filter was encounter) </li>
        <li>Updated configuration element processing so that all valid configuration blocks
            (matching both OS and LCID filters) will be executed (previously, only the first
            matching block was executed) </li>
        <li>Added environment variable processing support to component commands where the component
            type is "cmd" or "msi" </li>
        <li>Modified complete_command handling so that dotNetInstaller will wait for Command_Complete
            to finish executing </li>
        <li>Added complete_command_silent to allow overriding complete_command on silent install
        </li>
        <li>Added OS filter identifiers for Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP1, Windows
            Server 2003 SP2, and Windows Vista SP1 </li>
        <li>Added optional configuration-level and component-level OS filter matching system
            architecture (x86, x64, etc). See "processor_architecture_filter". This filter restricts
            the entire boostrapper from running on non-supported processors and enables installation
            of different dependencies on different processor architectures </li>
        <li>Added CABing, embedding of support files using <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/files/CABCompressExtract.aspx">
            Elmü's CAB library</a> and a PackagedSetup sample </li>
        <li>Added an "Embed File" component, child of "configuration" and "component", to embed
            support files when /Embed is specified </li>
        <li>Added /ExtractCab command line option to dotNetInstaller.exe that extracts the embedded
            CAB file and its contents in the current directory </li>
        <li>Added InstallerLinker.exe with command line options /e (Embed) and /a (AppPath)
            and /v (Verbose) for using in build processes </li>
        <li>Added /EmbedFile and /EmbedFolder command line options to InstallerLinker to embed
            individual files and folder structures </li>
        <li>Added support for embedding an icon that can replace the default setup icon
        </li>
        <li>Added "cab_dialog_message", "cab_cancelled_message", "cab_dialog_caption", "cab_path"
            and "cab_path_autodelete" options </li>
        <li>Temporary files (eg. downloaded files) will be deleted upon completion of dotNetInstaller
        </li>
        <li>Added /Log command-line option and "log_enabled" configuration file parameter that
            enables logging for dotNetInstaller and all MSI components executed </li>
        <li>Added /LogFile &lt;path\filename&gt; command-line option and a log_file configuration
            file parameter to specify the resulting full path to the log filename for the dotNetInstaller
            itself </li>
        <li>Added application version and operating system header to the log output as well
            as a timestamp in front of every log entry </li>
        <li>Added #CABPATH variable that can be used in path settings </li>
        <li>Added #GUID variable that represents a unique GUID across a single instance of dotNetInstaller
        </li>
        <li>Added an MSBuild script that centrally versions, builds and packages dotNetInstaller
            into target/Debug|Release, including a sample </li>
        <li>Added a combined Visual Studio solution, dni.sln with automatic versioning (reqiures
            <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">MSBuild Community Tasks</a>); the major
            and minor version number can be incremented in dni.proj, the build number is the
            latest SVN revision and the release number is a timestamp </li>
        <li>Added features to specify additional binary information, including copyright or
            company name, specifically "file_version" and "product_version" configuration attributes,
            as well as free-formed string attributes, using <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/ResourceLib.aspx">
                ResourceLib</a> </li>
        <li>Added a component "required" option; a required component cannot be de-selected
            in the Advanced tab and complete_command is only executed when all reqiured components
            have been installed </li>
        <li>Added /CompleteCommandArgs "value" to dotNetInstaller.exe to pass additional parameters
            to "complete_command" and "complete_command_silent" </li>
        <li>Added horizontal scrollbars in component lists that can't fit all the text in
